## Code
- modify PeerJS to communicate via Firebase (hard!)
- hide API keys, etc
- create favicon
- switch to Material lite
- upgrade code to ES2015

## Game
- check for game end
- when black, put the light somewhere else
- add animation to initial camera movement
- add loading screen
- fix board UV mapping
- replace multiple tile colors with a "glowy" effect for last-piece moved (same color)
- consider using fog effect
- think about user-controlled panning or view shift
? rethink UI, clicking
? improve look of pieces
? change board and pieces models
? add computer mode
? keep history of moves, perhaps display it somehow

## Bugs
- fix issue with tile controls
- fix strange SSAO rendering issue (actually, looks to be shadow issue - unrelated to SSAO pass)
- user can exit out of promotion screen
- user can move opponent's pieces on their turn
