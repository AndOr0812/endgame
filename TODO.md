## Code
! hide API keys, etc
- switch to Material lite
- upgrade code to ES2015

## Game
! replace tiles with glowy circle effect
! check for game end
! think about user-controlled panning or view shift
! show captured pieces somewhere
! add anonymous portrait when video is not present
- consider adding sounds
- consider adding touch support (test on tablets, etc)
? rethink UI, clicking
? improve look of pieces
? change board and pieces models
? add computer mode
? keep history of moves, perhaps display it somehow

## Bugs
- tile highlight doesn't update when clicking on new tile, until mouse move
? fix strange SSAO rendering issue (actually, looks to be shadow issue - unrelated to SSAO pass)
